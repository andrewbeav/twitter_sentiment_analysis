Command line (for now ?) app that uses sentiment analysis to tell the user how people on twitter are currently feeling about a particular topic.

Examples:

```
$ python3 twitter_sentiment_analysis.py cookies
In general, people on twitter feel postive about cookies right now
```

```
$ python3 twitter_sentiment_analysis.py hitler
In general, people on twitter feel negative about hitler right now
```
